# What is Python?

Python is a programming language that is used for a wide variety of applications. It is a high-level language, which means that it is designed to be easy to read and write. It is also an interpreted language, which means that it is not compiled into machine code before running. Instead, it is interpreted line-by-line by a program called the Python interpreter.
