# Concurrency

## What is Concurrency?

Concurrency is the ability to run multiple programs or parts of a program in parallel. It is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

## Why Concurrency?

Concurrency is a way to structure software, particularly as a way to write clean code that interacts well with the real world. It is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

## How to Concurrency?

### Threads

A thread is a sequence of instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### Processes

A process is a program that is being executed. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### Asyncio

Asyncio is a library for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### GIL

The GIL is a mechanism used in Python to synchronize access to objects. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### Locks

A lock is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### Semaphores

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that can be used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system such as an operating system. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### Queues

A queue is a data structure that stores items in the order in which they were added. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

### Gevent

[Gevent](https://www.gevent.org/) is a coroutine-based Python networking library that uses greenlet to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of the libev or libuv event loop. This is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently of each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
